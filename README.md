httpmq
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hnlq715/httpmq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hnlq715/httpmq)

Httpmq is a simple HTTP message queue written in Go with goleveldb, just like httpsqs wriiten in C with Tokyo Cabinet.

Feature
======

* Very simple, less than 300 lines Go code.
* Very fast, more than 10000 requests/sec.
* High concurrency, support the tens of thousands of concurrent connections.
* Multiple queue.
* Low memory consumption, mass data storage, storage dozens of GB of data takes less than 100MB of physical memory buffer.
* Convenient to change the maximum queue length of per-queue.
* Queue status view.
* Be able to view the contents of the specified queue ID.
* Multi-Character encoding support.

Usage
======
  ```
  Usage of ./httpmq:
    -auth="": auth password to access httpmq
    -buffer=4: write buffer(MB)
    -cache=8: cache size(MB)
    -cpu=1: cpu number for httpmq
    -db="level.db": database path
    -ip="0.0.0.0": ip address to listen on
    -maxqueue=1000000: the max queue length
    -port="1218": port to listen on
    -readtimeout=15: read timeout for an http request
    -verbose=true: output log
    -writetimeout=15: write timeout for an http request
  ```

1. PUT text message into a queue

  HTTP GET protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl "http://host:port/?name=your_queue_name&opt=put&data=url_encoded_text_message&auth=mypass123"
  ```
  HTTP POST protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl -d "url_encoded_text_message" "http://host:port/?name=your_queue_name&opt=put&auth=mypass123"
  ```

2. GET text message from a queue

  HTTP GET protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl "http://host:port/?charset=utf-8&name=your_queue_name&opt=get&auth=mypass123"
  ```

3. View queue status

  HTTP GET protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl "http://host:port/?name=your_queue_name&opt=status&auth=mypass123"
  ```
4. View queue details

  HTTP GET protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl "http://host:port/?name=your_queue_name&opt=view&pos=1&auth=mypass123"
  ```
5. Reset queue

  HTTP GET protocol (Using curl for example):
  ```
  curl "http://host:port/?name=your_queue_name&opt=reset&pos=1&auth=mypass123"
  ```
